<!-------------Intro Article-------------->
    <article id ="bio">Hello! <i><strong>If you do not know who I am already </strong></i> - My name is
        Judd Seger and I am from a little "hole in the wall" town in Pennsylvania.
        I am married and have a very energetic ten year old son. I have a programming
        background and have used languages that include C++, Java, JavaScript,
        Visual C++, and Visual Basic among others. I also enjoy using Linux systems
        and have some experience with a few of those as well. I absolutely love
        technology and I enjoy being on the "tip of the sword" with everything that is new.

            <!--Below is the article for the header-->

            <article><strong>HEADER</strong><br><p>
                As with most other headers, a company brand logo is included and is usually located in the upper left
                part of the header. As you can see by my example the layout is flexible, in this case the company brand is
                located in the center of the header. Users are able to access different parts of the site using links
                that are also located in the header as well. These additional links are typically located to the right of the logo
                in the case of my example header the additional links are locate beneath.</p>
                <br>

                <strong id = "CVnum1">Content Visualization:<br></strong>

                <p>Headers are the most frequent location for global navigation links that span the site. The ideal arrangement is to
                    use an html list of links, styled with css to spread horizontally across a section of the header</p>

            <article><strong>CALL TO ACTION</strong><br>

                <p>A CTA can be a simple non-demanding request like "choose a color"
                    or "watch this video", or a much more demanding request like "Buy Now!". Typical CTA
                    work by requesting the audience to purchase a product or provide
                    personal details and contact information.</p>
                <strong id = "CVnum2">Content Visualization:<br></strong>

                <p>This call to action is a fairly simple one consisting of some text and an image. Typically call to Actions also include a link or button.</p>

                <p>Some features that are typically a part of most websites.<br>
                    <strong>Store: </strong> A storefront allows you to sell products on your website. If you sell products
                    an online store will let your customers purchase your material through your website.<br>
                    <strong>Content Management System: </strong> A website content manager allows you to change the contents of your website.<br>
                </p>

                <strong id = "CVnum3">Content Visualization:<br></strong>

                <p>In this example it look like there is obviously text and could also possibly be links.
                    Links - within a features section - would be beneficial to permit your users to go into more depth as to your features that you are promoting.</p>

            <article><strong>Blog</strong><br>

                <p> A blog is a discussion forum where
                you can make posts and people can post comments and others can post replies to those comments.
                One of the benefits of a blog is that it keeps people reading your material.
                A disadvantage is that you have to make relevant posts and also monitor the responses.</p>

                <strong id = "CVnum4">Content Visualization:<br></strong>

                <p>There are many ways that a blog can b developed, you can make scrolling testimonial box (something like a slideshow) by using
                    a standard Gallery Block and nest an image with captions.</p>

            <article><strong>Footer</strong><br>

                <p>A footer is an area at the bottom of a document page that
                    contains information, links etc. that is related to the content
                    on the websites pages.
                </p>

                <strong id = "CVnum5">Content Visualization:<br></strong>

                <p> The footer is typically made up of a footer tag and the content within.
                    The content that a footer is comprised of varies from website to website but typically
                    has an "About Us" Link, Contact Us Link, the websites Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, Site
                    Map and the Contact Details. Developers will also use the footer area to include information
                    about where the site was developed and who developed it.
                </p>
