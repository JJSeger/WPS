INSTRUCTIONS
to complete this assignment, do the following:

    Create a GitHub Pages Site:
    Let us first practice our existing HTML & CSS skills by building out a simple one-page website for the purpose of sharing our progress throughout the month. Start off by downloading or cloning my  wsp_project repository, in which I have created a folder structure and even a CSS reset which you are free to utilize.

    Then follow  these instructions to configure your site as 'GitHub Pages' so we can view it like a live website. If you have any difficulty try watching through this setup video as well. When you you have succeeded your page should be visible by something like 'username.github.io'.

    Your page should include:
        Custom branding, something you will revisit in future months.
        A introduction about yourself ( It helps us get to know each other! )
        Blog posts discussing your selected components
    Design Inspiration (5+):
    Now that you have your site created, we can get to work. To help us visualize what makes a good design, let's use some professional inspiration. Go to  templatemonster.com and crop out at least five unique website components that you'd like to build out within the next few weeks.

    For each component, create an 'article'/post on your GitHub Page including:
        Component Image
        An explanation as to what it communicates to the user
        Attempt to conceptualize how you might build this
    Featured Component:
    Choose one of your components to be the primary focus of your research into web standards and semantic development. For this component add two additional elements to it's analysis, attempting to deconstruct it. Ultimately giving you more of a step-by-step process to follow as you start to develop.
        Visual deconstruction of structure (sizing, margins, padding)
        Style-guide key identifying any fonts and colors.

DELIVERABLES
to submit this assignment:

    Work In Progress:
    Throughout the week utilize out class Slack group to request feedback provide feedback with the class.
    Final Submission:
    Before the deadline make a simple text document including the link to your updated GitHub Page and submit it to this assignment.
