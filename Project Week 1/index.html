<article id ="bio">Hello! If you do not know who I am already - My name is
    Judd Seger and I am from a little "hole in the wall" town in Pennsylvania.
    I am married and have a very energetic ten year old son. I have a programming
    background and have used languages that include C++, Java, JavaScript,
    Visual C++, and Visual Basic among others. I also enjoy using Linux systems
    and have some experience with a few of those as well. I absolutely love
    technology and I enjoy being on the "tip of the sword" with everything that is new.

        <h2>HEADER</h2>
        <img src="img/header.jpg" alt="" class = "img-responsive">

        <article><strong>HEADER</strong><br><p>
            As with most other headers, a company brand logo is included and is usually located in the upper left
            part of the header. As you can see by my example the layout is flexible, in this case the company brand is
            located in the center of the header. Users are able to access different parts of the site using links
            that are also located in the header as well. These additional links are typically located to the right of the logo
            in the case of my example header the additional links are locate beneath.</p>
            <br>
            <strong id = "num1">Content Visualization:<br></strong>
<p>Headers are the most frequent location for global navigation links that span the site. The ideal arrangement is to
    use an html list of links, styled with css to spread horizontally across a section of the header</p>

        <h2>CALL TO ACTION</h2>
        <img src="img/cta.jpg" alt="" class = "img-responsive">

        <article><strong>CALL TO ACTION</strong><br><p>A CTA can be a simple non-demanding request like "choose a color"
            or "watch this video", or a much more demanding request like "Buy Now!". Typical CTA
            work by requesting the audience to purchase a product or provide
            personal details and contact information.</p>
            <strong id = "num1">Content Visualization:<br></strong>
            <p>This call to action is a fairly simple one consisting of some text and an image. Typically call to Actions also include a link or button.</p>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <img src="img/features.jpg" alt="" class = "img-responsive">

        <article><strong>FEATURES</strong><br>
            <p>Some features that are typically a part of most websites.<br>
                <strong>Store: </strong> A storefront allows you to sell products on your website. If you sell products
                an online store will let your customers purchase your material through your website.<br>
                <strong>Content Management System: </strong> A website content manager allows you to change the contents of your website.<br>
            </p>
            <strong id = "num1">Content Visualization:<br></strong>
            <p>In this example it look like there is obviously text and could also possibly be links.
            Links - within a features section - would be beneficial to permit your users to go into more depth as to your features that you are promoting.</p>

        <h2>BLOG</h2>
        <img src="img/blog.jpg" alt="" class = "img-responsive">

        <article><strong>Blog</strong><br><p> A blog is a discussion forum where
            you can make posts and people can post comments and others can post replies to those comments.
            One of the benefits of a blog is that it keeps people reading your material.
            A disadvantage is that you have to make relevant posts and also monitor the responses.</p>
            <strong id = "num1">Content Visualization:<br></strong>
            <p>There are many ways that a blog can b developed, you can make scrolling testimonial box (something like a slideshow) by using
                a standard Gallery Block and nest an image with captions.</p>

        article><strong>Footer</strong><br>
        <p>A footer is an area at the bottom of a document page that
            contains information, links etc. that is related to the content
            on the websites pages.
        </p>
        <strong id = "num1">Content Visualization:<br></strong>
        <p> The footer is typically made up of a footer tag and the content within.
            The content that a footer is comprised of varies from website to website but typically
        has an "About Us" Link, Contact Us Link, the websites Terms of Service, </p>

INSTRUCTIONS
to complete this assignment, do the following:

    Create a GitHub Pages Site:
    Let us first practice our existing HTML & CSS skills by building out a simple one-page website for the purpose of sharing our progress throughout the month. Start off by downloading or cloning my  wsp_project repository, in which I have created a folder structure and even a CSS reset which you are free to utilize.

    Then follow  these instructions to configure your site as 'GitHub Pages' so we can view it like a live website. If you have any difficulty try watching through this setup video as well. When you you have succeeded your page should be visible by something like 'username.github.io'.

    Your page should include:
        Custom branding, something you will revisit in future months.
        A introduction about yourself ( It helps us get to know each other! )
        Blog posts discussing your selected components
    Design Inspiration (5+):
    Now that you have your site created, we can get to work. To help us visualize what makes a good design, let's use some professional inspiration. Go to  templatemonster.com and crop out at least five unique website components that you'd like to build out within the next few weeks.

    For each component, create an 'article'/post on your GitHub Page including:
        Component Image
        An explanation as to what it communicates to the user
        Attempt to conceptualize how you might build this
    Featured Component:
    Choose one of your components to be the primary focus of your research into web standards and semantic development. For this component add two additional elements to it's analysis, attempting to deconstruct it. Ultimately giving you more of a step-by-step process to follow as you start to develop.
        Visual deconstruction of structure (sizing, margins, padding)
        Style-guide key identifying any fonts and colors.

DELIVERABLES
to submit this assignment:

    Work In Progress:
    Throughout the week utilize out class Slack group to request feedback provide feedback with the class.
    Final Submission:
    Before the deadline make a simple text document including the link to your updated GitHub Page and submit it to this assignment.
